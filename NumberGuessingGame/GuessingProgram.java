//This program was created to guess a number chosen by the player between a given range.
// The player is asked to guess a number and whether the number guessed by the program is the playerâ€™s guess. 
// The player is asked to respond to the programs guess by stating whether the guess is correct, 
// a higher value, or a lower value. 
// This project was completed in Java.

//The programs folder should contain file 'NumberGuessingGame.java' and file 'GuessingProgram.java'
//The program will not run without both files.
