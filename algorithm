	~With kettle, same directions as with stove pot
	~With tea cup, fill cup with water and place inside a heating source (i.e. 	microwave, etc…). Set timer to achieve preferred heated temperature
	2.2 Turn off heating source when water is heated/boiled to desired 	temperature.
3. Put tea bag and boiled water together in cup
	3.1 Place tea bag inside cup or source used to heat water (i.e. stove pot, 	kettle, 	etc…)
